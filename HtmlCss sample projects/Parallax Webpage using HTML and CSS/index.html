        Horseback riding is not an activity most people think of, but it is a great escape for 
        some people. Horseback riding is not just saddling up and riding, people have to have a passion for horses and riding. Some things to keep in mind when riding is balance and knowledge on how to keep the horse under control. People can be told how to ride, but each person will have to find a style that works for them. When riding a horse the concept of time, destination and worries do not exist.

        The experience that the rider and horse goes through is very nerve racking. The race the athlete is hoping for is a clean and good run. The racer wants the horse and his or he
        rself to do their very best at what they are competing for the win or just the placing they want.

    <h2>Don't Follow Your Dreams.... Ride Them now </h2>
    <p>
        Riding horses is not to hard, but there are a few things to consider. Horses 
        can sense when someone is scared, which will cause the horse to spook, and another 
        is riding is a team effort so there has to be trust. Balance is major especially when
         the horse is running across the field and it becomes a little difficult to stay one do to
          the bouncing of the horse.
